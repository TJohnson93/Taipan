    description: In my mid teens I volunteered to coach Junior Rugby Union after a junior teams coach moved towns. I took on the responsibilities involved in teaching young players how to safely play rugby. I was able to teach them the ball skills and defensive skills required for them to progress in the later years. I made it a priority to train the players in a way that minimised injury and was still perform the many tasks required in a game of Rugby.,
